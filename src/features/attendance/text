//  also for admin attadnce report for each user it is considering if user clock in for 2 days so it only consider 2 day but logic should be like this 
//   working day and the days his or her attadnded and if not clocks in it says absent and wfh is not absent  you understand if not please ask qeustions and
//    we just have to updtae report sturcture not the any acctul record for any user

// ⏺ I understand! You want to fix the admin attendance report logic for calculating attendance statistics. Currently it's only counting days when users
//   actually clocked in, but it should count all working days in the period and mark missing clock-ins as absent.

//   Let me clarify the requirements:

//   📊 Current (Wrong) Logic:

//   - User clocks in 2 days → Report shows 2 total days
//   - Only counts actual attendance records

//   ✅ Correct Logic Should Be:

//   - Total Days = All working days in selected date range
//   - Present = Days user clocked in at office
//   - WFH = Days marked as Work From Home (not absent)
//   - Absent = Working days with no clock-in record
//   - Attendance Rate = (Present + WFH) / Total Working Days

//   🤔 Questions to Confirm:

//   1. Working Days Definition:
//     - Should weekends (Sat/Sun) be excluded from total working days?
//     - Are there specific holidays to exclude?
//   2. WFH vs Absent:
//     - WFH days count as "present" (not absent), correct?
//     - Only missing clock-ins with no WFH record = absent?
//   3. Date Range:
//     - This applies to the admin report when selecting "From Date" to "To Date"?
//     - Should work for any date range (daily/monthly/custom)?
//   4. Report Location:
//     - Is this in the admin dashboard attendance summary/report?
//     - Which specific component should I look at?

//   Once you confirm these details, I'll locate the report calculation logic and fix it to count all working days properly instead of just actual
//   attendance records.

// > sunday is off but it is considerd as presnt for allways \
//   \
//    WFH days count as "present" (not absent), correct? yes 
//       - Only missing clock-ins with no WFH record = absent? yes\
//   \
//    Date Range:
//       - This applies to the admin report when selecting "From Date" to "To Date"? yes
//       - Should work for any date range (daily/monthly/custom)? yes we have to make report for selected date range \
//   \
//   yes it is attadnce managment tab

// ⏺ Perfect! I understand the requirements:

//   ✅ Requirements Summary:

//   - Sundays: Always count as Present (automatic)
//   - WFH days: Count as Present (not absent)
//   - Missing clock-ins: Count as Absent (only if not WFH)
//   - Total Days: All days in date range (including Sundays as present)
//   - Works for: Any custom date range in admin attendance management

// ⏺ Let me find the admin attendance management component and the report calculation logic:

// ⏺ Read(components/admin/UnifiedAttendanceManagement.js)

// ⏺ Let me look for the attendance statistics calculation logic:

// ⏺ Search(pattern: "getAttendanceStats|stats|attendanceRate|total.*days|present.*count", glob: "**/*.js", output_mode: "content")
//   ⎿  Found 1814 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

// ⏺ Now let me find the actual statistics calculation logic in the firebaseService:

// ⏺ Search(pattern: "getAttendanceStats|totalDays|attendanceRate", glob: "**/firebaseService.js", output_mode: "content")
//   ⎿  Found 207 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

// ⏺ Perfect! I found the main issue in the getAttendanceStats function at /Users/developerlogam/Documents/logam-apk/logam-apk/lib/firebaseService.js.
